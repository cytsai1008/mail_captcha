# Project Overview

This project is a full-stack web application that demonstrates how to protect `mailto:` links from bots using Google reCAPTCHA v3. It consists of a separate backend and frontend.

*   **Backend:** Developed with Node.js, Express, and Axios. Its primary role is to handle reCAPTCHA v3 token verification by communicating with the Google reCAPTCHA API. It uses `dotenv` for managing environment variables, including the reCAPTCHA secret key and the target email address for `mailto:` links.
*   **Frontend:** A client-side application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a modern, responsive design inspired by `shadcn/ui`, implemented using the `basecoat` component library and `Tailwind CSS`. The UI displays a centered card with a loading spinner to inform the user of the reCAPTCHA verification status. Upon successful verification, it redirects the user to a dynamically generated `mailto:` link.

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js and npm installed.
*   A Google reCAPTCHA v3 site key and secret key.

### Backend (Node.js)

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    npm install --prefix backend
    ```
2. **Configure environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following content, replacing the placeholder values:
    ```
    RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY
    MAIL_TO_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
    ```
3. **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm start
    # or
    node server.js
    ```
    The server will typically run on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    npm install --prefix frontend
    ```
2. **Configure reCAPTCHA site key:**
    Open `index.html` and `script.js` in the `frontend` directory and replace `YOUR_SITE_KEY` with your actual reCAPTCHA v3 site key.
3. **Serve the frontend:**
    ```bash
   cd frontend
    npm start
    # or, if http-server is globally installed or run directly:
    npx http-server -c-1
    ```
    Open `http://localhost:8080` (or the port indicated by `http-server`) in your web browser.

## Development Conventions

The project enforces code quality and consistency using various linting tools:

*   **JavaScript (Backend & Frontend):** ESLint is used for linting JavaScript code.
    *   Backend configuration: `backend/eslint.config.js`
    *   Frontend configuration: `frontend/eslint.config.mjs`
    *   Run linting: `npm run lint` (in respective directories)
*   **CSS (Frontend):** Stylelint is used for linting CSS files.
    *   Configuration: `frontend/.stylelintrc.json`
    *   Run linting: `npm run lint:css` (in `frontend` directory)
*   **HTML (Frontend):** HTMLHint is used for linting HTML files.
    *   Configuration: `frontend/.htmlhintrc`
    *   Run linting: `npm run lint:html` (in `frontend` directory)

The `frontend` directory also has a combined linting script: `npm run lint` which runs `lint:js`, `lint:css`, and `lint:html`.
